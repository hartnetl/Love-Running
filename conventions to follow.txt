When writing you css remember that the more general rules HAVE TO come first.

Importing fonts etc. always goes to the top of the style sheet 

Set padding, margin and border for all elements to zero
(The asterix wildcard selector allows you to do this)

Write commit notes in present tense

For visual balance, use multiples of a number. 
In love running project this was set at 75 (so 150, 300, 600, 900 and 1200 all appear)
